The `'secondary'` color (electric lime) is a decorative accent; use it for graphical flourishes like borders, sticker backgrounds, or icon backdrops. Do NOT use the `'secondary'` color for text on the `'background'`, as it lacks contrast. Instead, use `'secondaryForeground'` for any text placed on top of `'secondary'` elements.

The `'secondary'` color (lime green) does NOT meet contrast standards against `'background'` and must be restricted to non-text graphical elements or backgrounds.

Combine 'primary' and 'background' for text and backgrounds respectively to ensure clarity, and use 'secondary' backgrounds for emphasis or section differentiation.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primary' color on 'background' provides excellent contrast exceeding WCAG AA standards for text readability. The 'secondary' background with 'secondaryForeground' text also meets WCAG AA contrast ratios, ensuring accessibility in darker sections. Button text on 'buttonBackground' with 'buttonBorder' outlines maintains sufficient contrast for interactive elements. Overall, the palette supports strong accessibility compliance across all UI components."
